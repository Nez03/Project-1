        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I studied BSc(Hons) Business Information Systems at university over 10 years ago, since then I have had not much in the way of developing my skills since then.</p>
        <p>Though, I have not done much in the portfolio aspect, I manage to work and gain some experience in the basics of developing a framework of HTML and CSS pages in order for the back-end developers to add functionality to those pages also I gained experience in the maintainance of CMS systems such as Wordpress and Sitefinity.</p>
        <p>I do understand that the world of the front-end development has moved on from the basic HTML and CSS of my time, what I enjoy about this type of development is watching the code I created working, seeing a design come to life.
